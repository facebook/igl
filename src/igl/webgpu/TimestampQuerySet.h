/// @brief A timestamp query set and its asynchronous readback, shared by ITimer and
/// ITimestampQueries.
///
/// A command buffer that writes queries resolves them before it is finished (encodeResolve()) and
/// maps the readback buffer once it is submitted (mapAfterSubmit()). Results arrive through
/// WebGPU's event processing; poll() processes events and reports whether a resolve has completed,
/// whose timestamps stay readable until a newer one completes. Every resolve uses its own readback
/// buffer, so a query set can be resolved again while an earlier readback is still pending.
///
/// Not thread-safe: like the rest of the device, it is used from one thread at a time, and the
/// getters process WebGPU events on the calling thread.
