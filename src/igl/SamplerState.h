 *
 * The type and valid ranges for mip lod min/max were decided based on:
 * - Ability to hash a SamplerStateDesc: the current implementation
 *   relies on perfect hashing and we don't have many free bits left.
 * - Realistic use cases: negative values aren't useful (Metal says so)
 *   and big values aren't either (GL says so). In practice, a texture
 *   will only have log2(max_size) lods so a value of 16 is more than
 *   any of our platforms support.
