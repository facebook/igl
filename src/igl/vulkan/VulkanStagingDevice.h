 * This class automatically allocates and uses a staging buffer when transferring data between the
 * CPU and device-local resources. Transfers between the CPU and host-visible resources are copied
 * directly to the device, without the intermediary copy to the staging buffer. The staging buffer
 * is lazily allocated and grows as needed when the uploaded data cannot be transferred in small
 * chunks and is larger than the current staging buffer's size. The maximum size of the buffer is
 * determined at runtime and is the minimum between VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::VkPhysicalDeviceLimits
 * and 256 MB. Some architectures limit the size of staging buffers to 256MB (buffers that are both
 * host and device visible).
