 * `createCommandBuffer()` and reset in `endCommandBuffer()` (automatically called from `submit()`).
 * This class also implements shader debugging facilities, which are executed after a command buffer
 * is submitted. This extra pass is only executed if the context provides additional information for
 * rendering. It is disabled by default.
