/** @brief Stores uniform and storage buffer bindings, as well as bindings for textures and sampler
 * states for Vulkan. This class maintains vectors for each type of shader resource available in IGL
 * and records the association between binding locations (indices) and the Vulkan objects, while
 * performing specific checks for each type of resource when they are bound. The associations
 * between indices and resources is kept locally and does not affect the GPU until
 * `updateBindings()` is called. This class also records which resource types need to be updated
 * when `updateBindings()` is called and provides a convenience function to update the descriptor
 * sets on the context for all resource types. It only performs the update for a resource type that
 * has been modified after the last call to update the bindings. An instance of this class is bound
 * to one bind point only (VkPipelineBindPoint), which is VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS by
 * default.
